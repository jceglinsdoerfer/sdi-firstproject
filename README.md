This project reaches out to the crypto currency API (https://www.coinlore.com/cryptocurrency-data-api)
We return the current top 10 crypto currencies and display them.  We then also prompt the user to input the number of currencies they have and we return the current value of those coins.  It also keeps the record if they user has multiple coins.
